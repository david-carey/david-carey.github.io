2013	Micromechanics of elastic buckling of a colloidal polymer layer on a soft substrate: experiment and theory	Granular Matter	We study the buckling instability of a colloidal particle layer adhered to an elastic substrate using an integrated experimental and theoretical approach. Experiments using monodisperse colloid-scale spherical particles made of polystyrene and silica, show that the wavelength of the initial (critical) buckling mode is independent of particle modulus and linearly dependent on particle radius—in contradiction with the predictions of the prevailing continuum model. We developed a granular model of the particle layer using structural mechanics techniques. The granular model predicts the observed wavelength of the initial, critical buckling mode within the estimated range of parameter values for the experiment. The evolution of this mode into the post-buckling regime is examined. Results highlight the crucial role of material discreteness in the mechanical response, and the need for accurate methods of estimating parameters for the particle-scale resistances against buckling.

2016	Predicting ratings of perceived exertion in Australian football players: methods for live estimation.	International Journal of Computer Science in Sport	The ability of machine learning techniques to predict athlete ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) was investigated in professional Australian football players. RPE is commonly used to quantifying internal training loads and manage injury risk in team sports. Data from global positioning systems, heart-rate monitors, accelerometers and wellness questionnaires were recorded for each training session (n=3398) from 45 professional Australian football players across a full season. A variety of modelling approaches were considered to investigate the ability of objective data to predict RPE. Models were compared using nested cross validation and root mean square error (RMSE) on RPE predictions. A random forest model using player normalised running and heart rate variables provided the most accurate predictions (RMSE ± SD = 0.96 ± 0.08 au). A simplification of the model using only total distance, distance covered at speeds between 18-24 km·h−1, and the product of total distance and mean speed provided similarly accurate predictions (RMSE ± SD = 1.09 ± 0.05 au), suggesting that running distances and speeds are the strongest predictors of RPE in Australian football players. The ability of non-linear machine learning models to accurately predict athlete RPE has applications in live player monitoring and training load planning.	Carey, D. L., Ong, K., Morris, M.
